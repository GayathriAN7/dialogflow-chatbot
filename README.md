## Dialogflow Chatbot

[Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/) is a Google-owned developer of humanâ€“computer interaction technologies based on natural language conversations. The company is best known for creating the Assistant, a virtual buddy for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone smartphones that performs tasks and answers users' question in a natural language.

## Python API:

We have created API in Python which could manipulate the data from our own MySQL database and sends it to the Dialogflow chatbot.

When a user sends a message to the chatbot, the chatbot agent identifies which intents, parameters and entities using it's NLP and Machine Learning models which are trained upon the sets of example provided by us.
